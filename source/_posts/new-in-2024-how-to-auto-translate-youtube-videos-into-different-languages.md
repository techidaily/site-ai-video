2. If the video is over an hour in length, YouTube's automatic caption software fails to capture the dialogue in an efficient way.
3. If the video has a lower audio quality or the dialogue uses a specific word multiple times, it is hard to decipher for the auto-translate AI.
4. Long periods of silence at the beginning or end of the video can also throw off the software.
5. If a video has multiple speakers with overlapping dialogue, it can confuse the software and make errors in translation.

It also matches the lip-synching to give you synchronized talking videos in a different language.  What’s more, you can also set Virbo to proofread the generated text before translation. This removes any unnecessary or repeated words, making your subtitles crisp and concise. You can also download translated subtitles as SRT or TXT files and use them the way you want.

### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu

Accuracy

Even the best human translators sometimes struggle with complex sentences, slang, or thick accents. Real-time translation of videos using AI is similar. While it’s constantly learning, it might misunderstand some things. So, keep things simple and clear in your videos, especially if your audience might need real-time translation.

Latency

Imagine you’re having a conversation, but there’s a slight pause between your words and the other person’s response. It throws things off a bit, right? That’s kind of what latency is like in **real-time video translation**. There’s a short delay between what’s spoken and the translated text appearing. For critical conversations, consider using pre-recorded videos with translated subtitles or voiceovers.

Supported Languages

Apps that translate videos in real-time are getting better at handling a wider range of languages, but some are more supported than others. Check the app you’re considering and the languages it supports. If your language isn’t on the list, you might need to look for alternative solutions.

The apps listed here are powerful, but choosing the right one depends on your needs. If you want to understand the content, real-time translation is perfect. But consider AI voice cloning if you need to create videos with a specific voice.

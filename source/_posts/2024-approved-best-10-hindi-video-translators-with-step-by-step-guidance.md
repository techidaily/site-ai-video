3. **Collaboration Features:** Filmmaking and editing require a crew and multiple editing platforms. That’s why it’s important to rely on collaborative software for the convenience. It allows many users to work on the same platform and keep track of the performance.
4. **Spell and Grammar Check:** To reduce manual efforts, there must be a built-in spell checker in the tool. It ensures that the translated subtitles are accurate. Also, this feature enables users to avoid typos and grammatical errors in the translation.
5. **Subtitle File Compatibility:** Editors often upload subtitles by importing a separate file. In such cases, auto-translate movie subtitle tools that allow you to work with the same files are the best. They must support file formats such as SRT, SUB, ASS, VTT, and a few others.
6. **Export Options:** There are a variety of platforms that people use for watching movies. Distributors want movies in different formats to share them on every streaming stage. So, a good tool must offer many export options after translating subtitles to play anywhere.
7. **Subtitle Timing Adjustments:** To emphasize certain dialogues, users want a few subtitles to remain on screen for longer. It is necessary for a tool to offer editing subtitle options to match users’ specific needs. By doing such manual adjustments, you can enhance viewing experiences.

## Part 3. Chrome Extensions vs. Offline Tools

In the above sections, we have highlighted a few Chrome video translator extensions. Notably stating, most of them can translate subtitles only and do not offer video translation. If we compare it with offline tools, such extensions also require an active internet connection. They also lack translated video saving and sharing to your device.

Thus, you should consider an offline tool that allows you personalization options. Look for a tool with translating customization options like selecting a gender, voice, or accent. In this regard, you can head to the next section and explore such a video translation tool.

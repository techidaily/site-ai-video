Below are some alternatives you can use if Google Translate is unavailable. These options are just as good, if not better.

### 1\. Virbo

![Wondershare Virbo](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/google-translate-a-video-04.jpg)

 [Translate Video Online](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/virbo/download/) [Free Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/virbo/download/)


We previously mentioned [Virbo](https://virbo.wondershare.com/app/video-translate) for burning subtitles on your Video. But you can also use it to translate a video, edit subtitles, create instant dubs/voiceovers, make AI avatar videos and do so much more.

### 2\. Microsoft Translator

![Microsoft Translator](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/google-translate-a-video-05.jpg)

[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) is another great option for video translation. It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages. It’s only available for 103 languages, which is still more than big name translation services. A unique feature of Microsoft Translator is that it is also compatible with the MS Office suite. So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.

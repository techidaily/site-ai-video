## Part 4. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

## Part 4. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

That’s all. We hope now you know how **auto translate for YouTube** works. With this feature, you can **translate YouTube video to English,** or any other language according to your needs. It’s easy and super helpful for watching content in any language.

## Part 2: Limitations of YouTube Auto Translate Feature

Like all good things, **auto translate for YouTube captions** feature is not without its faults. Below are some of it’s limitations:

1. While YouTube is slowly rolling out the feature for all languages, automatic captions still don’t support many regional languages
2. If the video is over an hour in length, YouTube's automatic caption software fails to capture the dialogue in an efficient way.
3. If the video has a lower audio quality or the dialogue uses a specific word multiple times, it is hard to decipher for the auto-translate AI.
4. Long periods of silence at the beginning or end of the video can also throw off the software.
5. If a video has multiple speakers with overlapping dialogue, it can confuse the software and make errors in translation.

### Why Choose Virbo?

Most AI video translators refer only to subtitles for translation. They translate verbatim and leave out the audio lip-synching from the final product. Virbo is different because it utilizes the latest AI advancements to understand the context of a dialogue, giving you highly accurate and precise results. It also matches the lip-synching to give you synchronized talking videos in a different language.  What’s more, you can also set Virbo to proofread the generated text before translation. This removes any unnecessary or repeated words, making your subtitles crisp and concise. You can also download translated subtitles as SRT or TXT files and use them the way you want.

### Language Support

Virbo currently supports translation in the following languages:

English, Chinese, Spanish, Arabic, Portuguese, Indonesian, French, Russian, German, Japanese, Italian, Korean, Thai, Filipino, Bengali, Turkish, Dutch, Swedish, Croatian, Romanian, Czech, Hindi, Ukrainian, Vietnamese, Malay, Slovak, Danish, Tamil, Polish, Greek, Finnish, Burmese, Urdu

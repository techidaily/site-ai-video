Just head onto the internet with your favorite search engine, and search for the subtitle file of the video or film you are interested in. Download the .srt file your file and then upload it to Subtitle Cat.

Step 4Download Translated Subtitles

The Cat subtitle translate is often quick and takes only a few seconds for the tools to generate subtitles in the requested language. Once the translation process is complete, download your new subtitle file for your video. The file contains the subtitles for your video file.

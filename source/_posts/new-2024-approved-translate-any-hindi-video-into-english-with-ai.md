## Part 4. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

## Part 1. Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil

Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to **Tamil language translate to English**:

### Meaning

Translating is converting the meaning of spoken words or written text from one language to another, like English convert to Tamil meaning. It ensures that the essence and intent remain intact. Transcribing focuses on converting spoken words into written text. It captures the dialogue or narration without considering the nuances of translation.

### Context

Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.

### Nuances

Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words. It often doesn’t consider the linguistic nuances or cultural context.

Automatic translation tools like YouTube can do video translation in Tamil. But, they often struggle to capture the nuances of translating and transcribing. AI-powered apps like [<u>Wondershare Virbo</u>](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) offer a solution by combining translation and transcription.

### YouTube Video Translation

YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:

- **Step 1**: Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the **Subtitles/CC** tab.

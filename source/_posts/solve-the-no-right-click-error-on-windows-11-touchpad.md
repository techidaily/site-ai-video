## Solve the No Right Click Error on Windows 11 Touchpad

 Some users have found that the right-click button on their laptop touchpad suddenly stopped working, which makes it quite tricky to view more property options by right-clicking.

 This is rather strange while the left click and the navigation zone work just fine. Up till now, there is no solid explanation as to why this error keeps happening. But there are some effective workarounds that might be able to help. You may not need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that works.

[**Option 1: Enable your touchpad**](https://copa.sjv.io/6eoowq)

**[Option 2: Check your touchpad setting](https://ship7com.pxf.io/0zwaz3)**

**[Option 3: Reinstall your driver](https://turtlebeachus.sjv.io/vmebyo)**

**[Option 4: Update your driver](https://tinyland.pxf.io/org4ra)**

**Note** : Before you proceed, it is suggested that you plug in a mouse.

### **Option 1: Enable your touchpad**

 1) Click**Start** button, and then choose**Settings** . Then choose**Devices** .

 3) Then the **Mouse Properties**  window will open. Go to the furthest right option (the name of this option could be **Device Settings** or **ELAN**), then make sure your touchpad is enabled.

 If the option you see here is**Device Settings** , check to see if the the Touchpad is enabled. If not, you need to press the**Settings** button to change the status to**Enabled** .

 4) You should also check to see if there is a function key that enables or disables the touchpad. On some laptop, this key is **F6** , or the combination of **Fn+F5** , or **Fn+F6**  . The icons looks like a tiny touchpad with a diagonal line through it. You should check your manual to see which key or keys could be at fault.

### Option 2: Check your touchpad setting

 Sometimes the primary settings for your touchpad may be changed after Windows Updates. Make sure you’ve enabled those settings that are essential to the proper functioning of your touchpad’s right-click button. Here’s how to do it:

 1) On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo key** and**I** at the same time to invoke the**Settings** window.

 2) Go to**Devices** .

 4) Windows will start helping you find the latest version of touchpad driver that it could find. But if you see the notification like the following one:

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/img_58633c3acc5d9.png)

You might need to search for the driver by yourself on the Internet.

 But the whole process of searching for and then download and install the driver could be a hassle: you need to decide what driver you need, then choose from the manufacturer website the right one for your operating system, and you probably need to install it in compatibility mode, since some manufacturers have not yet released touchpad driver for Windows 10.

 In this case, it is suggested that you use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to save yourself that much time and effort, as illustrated in Way 2.

#### **Way 2 – Automatically update your drivers**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing. Driver Easy takes care of everything.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to a flagged driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)

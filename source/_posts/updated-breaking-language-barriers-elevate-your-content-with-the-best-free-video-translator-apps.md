[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) is another great option for video translation. It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages. It’s only available for 103 languages, which is still more than big name translation services. A unique feature of Microsoft Translator is that it is also compatible with the MS Office suite. So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.

### 3\. SubtitleBee

## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.

## Part 2: Important Factors to Consider While Translating Videos

In the vibrant landscape of digital content, the ability to transcend linguistic boundaries is a crucial aspect of reaching a diverse audience. When venturing into the realm of video translation, it's essential to consider various factors to ensure an accurate and meaningful representation of your content. Let's delve into the key considerations that can significantly impact the quality of your video translations.

### 1\. Content Accuracy

In the intricate dance of video translation, accuracy takes center stage. When selecting a video translation tool, it's imperative to prioritize those that not only promise but guarantee precise content translation. The soul of your message lies in its accuracy, and choosing a tool that preserves the essence and nuances of the original message establishes a deep and meaningful connection with your viewers through every frame of the translated content.

### 2\. Language Support

The beauty of global content creation lies in its linguistic diversity. Opt for a video translator that transcends language boundaries—a true polyglot. Choosing a tool with broad language support empowers you to cater to the diverse linguistic preferences of your audience, creating an inclusive and accessible viewing experience. Your selected tool should be a gateway to a world where language is not a barrier but a bridge.

### 3\. Subtitle Customization

Visual elements, especially subtitles, contribute significantly to the overall viewer experience. Seek a video translator that goes beyond the basics, offering options for customizing subtitles. The ability to adjust not only the appearance but also the timing of subtitles ensures that your translated content aligns seamlessly with the rhythm and tone of your original video. This customization transforms your subtitles from a mere translation tool to an integral part of your storytelling.

### 4\. User-Friendly Interface

In the fast-paced and dynamic landscape of content creation, efficiency is the key to success. Choose a video translation tool adorned with a user-friendly interface—a design that is intuitive and serves as a compass guiding both beginners and experienced users effortlessly through the translation process. A tool that feels familiar and accessible contributes not only to a smoother workflow but also to a more enjoyable and productive content creation experience.

### 5\. Offline Functionality

In a world where the ubiquity of the internet is not guaranteed, the ability to navigate offline is a valuable asset. Consider a video translator that offers offline capabilities, allowing you to enjoy translated content even when a stable internet connection is elusive. This feature provides convenience and flexibility, ensuring your content creation journey is not hindered by connectivity constraints.

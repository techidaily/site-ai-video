[Microsoft Translator](https://translator.microsoft.com/) is another great option for video translation. It allows real time translated conversations across multiple devices and platforms. Another difference between Google and Microsoft Translator is that Microsoft’s Translator supports fewer languages.

So you can use it with MS Excel, One Note, PowerPoint and Outlook. Lastly, this tool is particularly helpful with contextual understanding of a sentence.

## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.

## How to Translate TikTok Videos: Top 5 Auto Translate Tools

Popular creators like Mr Beast, Alex Hormozi, Jordan Peterson, and others have started to understand the power of languages. At some point in our lives, we used to think that English was a universally spoken language. But that is far from the truth. Targeting audiences from different languages is made easy with **TikTok video translators****,** and that’s what we are about to cover today.

So, whether you are an influencer, an educational institute looking to bring TikTok presence, or just want to target the audience of a specific country, here are the top 5 auto translation tools for TikTok.

## **Part 1.** Must-read tips for Translating TikTok Videos

###### **1\. Context and intent matter**

When it comes to translating videos, you must understand the context and intent of the original video. You should also pay attention to the humor, tone, and overall message the creator is trying to convey. This can be important if you are reposting other creators' content.

###### **2\. Choosing the right translation tool**

There are many auto-translate tools for TikTok. However, not all of them are equal. Some are accurate, while some don’t do the job properly. It is important for you to understand which tool to pick.

Consider factors such as _accuracy, fluency, and ability to handle slang and informal language_. In the third part, we will cover the top 5 best auto-translate tools for TikTok.

###### **3\. Double-check the accuracy of the translation**

Even the most sophisticated translation tools can sometimes produce errors. It's essential to double-check the accuracy of the translated text, especially for puns, idioms, and culturally specific references.

## **Part 2.** How to Turn on TikTok's Auto Translate

While TikTok’s Auto Translate is not the strongest, it translates captions and text overlays from one language to another so viewers from different cultures won’t miss out on any content. Here’s how you turn on TikTok auto translate:

1. Go to your profile section on TikTok and click on the menu button.
2. Select “**Settings and Privacy**.”

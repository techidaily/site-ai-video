You can discover some more benefits of subtitle translation from the given section:

- **Language Accessibility:** Subtitles enable people with hearing impairments to enjoy the movie like others did. Similarly, subtitle translation ensures that people from different linguistic backgrounds can enjoy the film. It promotes equal access to cultures and entertainment. In today's interconnected world, it's crucial to make movies accessible to global audiences.
- **Cultural Exchange:** Some people are curious to know other cultures, traditions, and daily living. So, they frequently watch international movies and select one with translated subtitles.

A high-quality translation can lead to winning certain awards and competing on global forums.

## Part 2. What Should Be Present in A Good Subtitle Translator Tool?

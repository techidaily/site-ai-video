1. **Multi-language Support:** A tool is useless if it's not offering the language you want for translation. Thus, you should look for a tool that provides translation in a maximum number of languages. Avoid using any online movie subtitle translator that only offers basic language translations.
2. **Real-time Preview:** A good movie subtitle translator provides a real-time preview of the changes. This way, you can assess the quality and accuracy before downloading the movie. It proves beneficial in ensuring that subtitles are not overloaded and maintaining a flow.

6. **Export Options:** There are a variety of platforms that people use for watching movies. Distributors want movies in different formats to share them on every streaming stage. So, a good tool must offer many export options after translating subtitles to play anywhere.

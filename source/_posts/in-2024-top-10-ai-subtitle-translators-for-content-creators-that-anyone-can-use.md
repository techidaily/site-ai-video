3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

## Part 1. Notice to Readers: Difference of Translating or Transcribing in Tamil

Translating and transcribing are two distinct processes. Each is crucial in its own right when it comes to **Tamil language translate to English**:

### Meaning

Translating is converting the meaning of spoken words or written text from one language to another, like English convert to Tamil meaning. It ensures that the essence and intent remain intact. Transcribing focuses on converting spoken words into written text. It captures the dialogue or narration without considering the nuances of translation.

### Context

Translation takes into account the broader context of the content. It often factors in cultural references and idiomatic expressions. It also takes into account societal norms to convey the message. Transcription deals with capturing the spoken words. It doesn’t delve into the context or cultural nuances.

### Nuances

Translation requires knowing both languages involved. It allows you to convey the nuances of the original content. Transcription focuses more on capturing the spoken words. It often doesn’t consider the linguistic nuances or cultural context.

Automatic translation tools like YouTube can do video translation in Tamil. But, they often struggle to capture the nuances of translating and transcribing. AI-powered apps like [<u>Wondershare Virbo</u>](https://virbo.wondershare.com/) offer a solution by combining translation and transcription.

There are alternative methods available if you prefer different English to Tamil translate approaches. Yet, it’s important to note that these methods cater to text translation. They may not capture the nuances and context of video content. Let’s explore two common alternatives:

### Google Translate

Google Translate is a well-known tool for translating text from one language to another, such as **English to Tamil translation**. Here’s how you can use it for basic translation:

- **Step 1**: Visit the Google Translate website or open the Google Translate app. Select the input and output languages (e.g., English to Tamil).

![video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/video-translate-in-tamil-07.jpg)

- **Step 2**: Type or paste the text you want to translate into the provided box. Google Translate will instantly translate the text into Tamil.

Remember that Google Translate may not always produce the most accurate translations. It’s especially evident for complex sentences or specialized terminology.

### YouTube Video Translation

YouTube offers a built-in feature for translating video titles and descriptions. It can also generate subtitles in many languages, including languages from English to Tamil. Here’s how you can use it:

- **Step 1**: Upload your video to YouTube and navigate to the video’s editing page. Click the **Subtitles/CC** tab.
- **Step 2**: Select the language you want to translate your subtitles into (e.g., Tamil). YouTube will automatically generate machine-translated subtitles.
- **Step 3**: Review and edit the translated subtitles to ensure accuracy and coherence.

**YouTube’s video translation in Tamil** feature can be helpful at times. But, it may not capture the nuances or cultural context accurately. Manual editing is often required to refine the translations. This is important to ensure they align with the original video content.

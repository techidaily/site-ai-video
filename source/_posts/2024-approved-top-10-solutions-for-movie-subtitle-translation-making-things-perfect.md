## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.

**ADVANCED FEATURES**

![advanced features in virbo online](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/translate-srt-14.jpg)

Wondershare Virbo comes with 3 advanced features:

1. You can use the power of AI to create perfectly lip-synced videos in line with the target language. Try it to believe it!
2. Enable Subtitle option to burn the translated subtitles directly into the video. This should only be done if there are no subtitles already present in the video.
3. Enabling Proofread Video Script option automatically parses and proofreads the video script for more accurate video translation.

## Conclusion

Gone are the days when you had to make separate videos for every language you wanted your videos to be in and had to hire linguists to proofread and check your subtitle files in case you were using subtitles in different languages for your videos. Today, you can auto translate subtitles online using any of the freely available online SRT translation tools. However, this guide shows you how to select the right tool for you, and as bonus, gives you an easy-to-use tool to translate videos into any language easily!

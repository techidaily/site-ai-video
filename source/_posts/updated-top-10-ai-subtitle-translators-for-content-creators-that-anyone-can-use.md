## Top 10 AI Subtitle Translators for Content Creators That Anyone Can Use

According to the Linguistic Society of America, there are over 7,000 languages in the world. In such a diverse world, there’s one way for any content creator to reach as many as possible: Subtitles. Yes, with subtitles, you can reach even those people who do not understand your language. There’s one problem, though. Manually subtitling is time and effort-consuming. It’s also prone to mistakes. Solution? **AI Subtitle Translator** tools. These handy tools quickly and efficiently change spoken content into written text in multiple languages. So, if you’re searching for the best subtitle translator to make your content stand out, we’re here to help. Read on to find out the 10 best AI subtitle translators available today!

## Part 1. How AI Subtitle Translators Work

**AI subtitle translators** generally use ASR and Machine Learning technologies to carry out the task. Automatic speech recognition technology converts spoken audio into text. The developers train these systems on vast amounts of audio data for text identification. Once the speech is transcribed, AI translation engines convert the text into the target language. Here is the complete breakdown of how these subtitle translators work:

1. **Input:** You provide the video or subtitle file containing the source language. For this, some translators allow you to paste the URL of videos. However, some require you to import the whole video or SRT file.
2. **Speech Recognition:** The AI system extracts the audio and converts it into text. In the case of only subtitle files, the systems will recognize the language of the uploaded SRT.
3. **Machine Translation:** The transcript is then fed into the machine translation engine. Afterward, the MT engines translate the text into the desired language.
4. **Output:** The translated text is displayed as subtitles synchronized with the video's audio. You will also be able to translate SRT into your desired language as a separate file.

## Part 2: How to Choose a Good Subtitle Translator?

## Part 4. Troubleshooting Issues When Converting Video Voice to Text

Creating clear and accurate transcripts is essential for professional settings. Here’s how to avoid common pitfalls that can impact transcription quality:

Issue 1: Background Noise

**Solution:** Noisy recordings can cause problems with transcription accuracy. Luckily, many video editing programs have noise-reduction features. Running your audio through one of these before conversion can make a big difference.

Issue 2: Accents or Dialects

**Solution:** Most speech recognition software is good these days, but accents and dialects can still trip them up. Check your software’s settings for options to adjust the recognition model. Some programs even let you upload a sample of the speaker’s voice to improve accuracy.

Issue 3: Punctuation Errors

**Solution:** Some software offers built-in punctuation correction you can use. If unavailable, find a separate grammar tool after conversion. Always proofread the transcript yourself for any missing punctuation.

Issue 4: Overlapping Voices of Speakers

**Solution:** If the video has multiple speakers, try software that can differentiate voices. This includes interviews and panel discussions. You can always transcribe each speaker’s section if that's not an option. Then, add timestamps to identify speaker changes in the transcript.

![online meeting concept](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/convert-video-voice-to-text-17.jpg)

Issue 5: Inconsistent Transcription Format

**Solution:** Most video-to-text software allows you to format after the converter generates the transcript. You can adjust fonts, add paragraph breaks, and even format speaker identification within the program. Also, you can always export the transcript to a word processor for in-depth formatting.

## Conclusion

You learned several ways to convert video voice to text online for free and the best apps for it. These tools make videos easier to understand, whether recorded or uploaded from websites like YouTube.

## Best 10 Free Video Translators to Mitigate Translation Risks

Translating videos using AI can be a valuable asset to a company. With so many **free video translators** on the market, there are many tools to choose from. However, these free tools can often cause many problems, drastically increasing the risk.

So, what are these risks, and how do we mitigate these risks? Let’s find out.

## **Part 1.** Potential Risks and Fixes of Translating Videos

Nowadays, companies are looking less and less to hire translators and leaning more towards AI. But it isn’t because of the fact that AI is more accurate. It’s because AI just takes a fraction of the time a real human has. So, what are the potential risks of translating videos? Let’s find out.

### 1\. Accuracy

One of the biggest issues with using free video translators is the accuracy. Video translation software uses machine translation and machine learning, which can sometimes produce unpredictable and inaccurate results. Moreover, misleading translations can mess up a translated video and can potentially cause problems in the long run. This can be especially problematic for videos that contain important information, such as news broadcasts or educational content.

The fix for accuracy is to get it reviewed by a translator who can then finally confirm whether the translation was done perfectly or not. Or, you should use a tool that is known for its high accuracy, which we will discover in the next part.

### 2\. Cultural Sensitivity

Videos often contain cultural references and humor that may not translate well into other languages. If not handled carefully, video translation can result in offensive or insensitive content. For example, we might not fully understand slang or jokes in one culture. To fix this issue, you can either simplify a video so it is understandable by everyone or use human review to explain it perfectly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Technical Problems

Most free tools have problems processing a video that is mildly complex to process. If your video contains complex audio or visual elements, you might not get the most out of translation, and the tool might not even work.

Another problem is that if a video has too much background noise, then the translation tool might not even detect certain words or phrases. In other words, you should aim for a video that is high-quality and even do some pre-translation editing to make sure that the translator can do its job perfectly.

## Part 3. How to Make Lip Sync Video Without Memorizing the Words

Making a ****TikTok lip-sync**** video can be challenging because you must remember and match the words with the music. But there are three simple methods to make it easier.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### Method 1: Record at slower speed

You can slow the speed down while recording instead of trying to keep up with the song. This technique lets you hear, understand, and follow the words more easily.

Here's how to slow down the recording:

- **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

Start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

- **Step 2.** Set the speed record slower.

On the recording screen, click on the Speed icon on the right side of the screen. To make it slower, choose 2x or 3x. This step will make your recording time 2 or 3 times longer than it should be.

![Set speed to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-7.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Tap on the red button.

Once you tap the red button, TikTok will play the song slower and record your lip-sync simultaneously. Repeat this step to help you memorize the lyrics and the beat of the songs.

Once you're comfortable, switch back to normal speed for the final recording. This method will save time and improve accuracy.

### Method 2: Purposely delay mouthing the words

While lip-syncing videos may vary in style and pacing, this technique can prove particularly useful for slower rhythms. Moreover, mastering the art of mouth sync on TikTok can elevate the overall production value of lip-syncing videos.

Using the timer feature will give you a slight lag between lip movements and audio playback. Then, it lets creators ensure more precise synchronization during editing. Here's how to lip-sync on TikTok more easily:

- **Step 1.** Follow steps 1 to step 4 from the step-by-step guide in Part 2.

Like Method 1, you can start by following the first to fourth steps from the guide in Part 2 above.

- **Step 2.** Delay the recording

On the recording screen, click on the Timer icon on the right side of the screen. Here, you can set the timer to 3 to 10 seconds to delay the recording's start. You can also drag and set the recording limit if you want.

![Set a timer to delay the recording](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/2024/03/tiktok-lip-sync-8.jpg)

- **Step 3.** Start the recording

Then click “Start recording” to record the video with the timer on.

### Method 3: Use a Photo Talking Tool

Next, consider using a Talking Photo feature by Wondershare Virbo. This method is for you who want to create engaging TikTok lip-sync videos without memorizing the words.

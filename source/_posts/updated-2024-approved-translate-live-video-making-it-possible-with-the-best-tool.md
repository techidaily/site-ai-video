## Part 2. What Challenges Can Occur if Video Translators Do Not Exist

Videos play a crucial role in delivering the message worldwide. People prefer to create video advertisements instead of putting ads in newspapers. Colorful and catchy videos grab the attention of the viewers and encourage them to buy the product. The main problem can occur if your target audience cannot understand the language that you have used in videos.

As we all know, English is one of the most spoken languages. But not everyone speaks or understands it. People can face various problems in understanding the language. That's why video translators play a crucial role in every person's life. If there is no video translator, the world will become dull. Let's discuss some challenges that can occur if video translators do not exist.

### 1\. Communication Gap Formed

If your viewers understand the Spanish language, but you are creating videos in other languages. It will create a communication barrier because your audience does not understand the language in the video. Language barriers can affect communication and lead to misunderstandings. Suppose you are posting video lectures on the website to offer courses. In this case, if you don't use a video language translator, it will misinterpret the viewers.

![Virbo allows export high-quality videos](https://images.wondershare.com/virbo/article/free-online-video-translator-4.jpg)

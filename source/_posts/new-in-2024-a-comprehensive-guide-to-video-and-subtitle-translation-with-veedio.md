## Part 3. Tips for Effective Translation - How To Translate Correctly With AI Tools

AI tools are just as good as people using them. If you’re not vigilant and don’t review the output, chances are you will get inaccurate or bad translations. Below are our tips to effectively **translate YouTube video without cc** that can help you get the most out of any AI translation tool.

### 01Understand the Context

AI tools often lack a complete understanding of the context. Writing a sentence out of context can totally change the message being conveyed. Therefore, you understand the overall meaning before finalizing a translation draft.

### 02Clear Up any Ambiguities

Ambiguous phrases are words in a language that convey more than one meaning, which can lead to inaccurate translations. So, clear up any ambiguous terms or expressions. Selecting a particular meaning of a phrase for your translation requires a keen eye for detail.

### 03Consider the Cultural Nuances

Every two cultures are different. This is particularly true if the two are from vastly different geographical regions of the world. So, you have to take into account the cultural nuances of both languages to ensure the translation doesn’t convey unintended meaning.

### 04Use Reputable & Accurate Tools

Always use reputable names for your transactions. There’s a good reason why some tools are more popular than others. Take Wondershare Virbo as an example. Virbo provides accurate and better translations for YouTube Videos than most other tools in the market.

### 05Don’t Be Afraid To Customize

Sometimes, the translation doesn’t need to be accurate word for word. You can customize the translation to convey the message in a better way. Some AI tools allow customization. You can adjust settings or provide additional context to improve the accuracy of a translation.

### 06Handle Idioms With Care

AI tools don’t translate idiomatic expressions in a good way. They translate in a literal way, which destroys the entire message. So, you should be aware of idiomatic expressions and always ready to find their best equivalents in a target language.

### 07Hire A Human Editor

If possible, have a human editor take a look and review the translation. The human eye can catch certain nuances that AI might miss. With a human editor, you have the confidence that they will be updated about translations and how to improve the message being conveyed.

## Conclusion

In short, translated videos are valuable sources for global communication. For this purpose, **Chrome video translator** extensions are used in many industries. This article has shed light on Chrome extensions that give translation of subtitles. So, using offline tools is preferable in this regard. They are better than such extensions due to the customization options in translation.

Take the example of [**Wondershare Virbo**](https://virbo.wondershare.com/), which offers AI translation in human-like voices. Unlike Chrome Extensions, you can define your translating parameters. It can turn your video into targeted language and select voice, tones, and accents. Apart from translation, it also provides AI avatars, video templates, and much more.

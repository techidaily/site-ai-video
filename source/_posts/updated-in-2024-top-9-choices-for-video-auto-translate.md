## Part 3. Guidelines for Creating Accurate Spanish Translation

##### **01**of 10Understand the Context

Most AI translation tools lack contextual understanding. Make sure the translated text provides complete sentences or phrases without skipping any important detail.

##### **02**of 10Check the Formality

Spanish has formal and informal forms of address. Make sure the Spanish to English video translation tool reflects the appropriate level of formality based on the context and relationship between the conversing parties.

##### **03**of 10Be Mindful of Idioms

Idiomatic expressions in Spanish don’t always have direct equivalents in English. AI tools may struggle with these, so be ready to simplify or rephrase to convey the intended message accurately.

##### **04**of 10Review Regional Variations

Spanish varies across regions. For instance, Spanish in Latin America is vastly different from Spanish in Spain. Therefore, you should consider the target audience's region and adjust translations accordingly, especially for colloquialisms and regional vocabulary.

##### **05**of 10Verify Technical Terms

For specialized or technical content, verify that the Spanish video translator understands and translates industry-specific terms correctly. You can provide additional context in the preview if needed.

##### **06**of 10Double-Check Tenses

Spanish and English express time differently. Ensure the AI captures the correct tense, especially in complex sentences, to convey the intended temporal meaning accurately.

##### **07**of 10Handle Gender Sensitively

Spanish had a binary (masculine/feminine) gender system only, while US English has multiple. Ensure the AI translates gender-sensitive terms appropriately and consistently throughout the text.

##### **08**of 10Consider Sentence Structure

Spanish and English have different sentence structures. Verify that the translated text maintains clarity and coherence while respecting the syntactic rules of the target language.

##### **09**of 10Proofread and Edit

AI tools may not catch nuanced errors. So, if you want to translate voice/videos from Spanish into any language, proofread the translated text. Check for grammatical accuracy, style, and overall fluency. Make necessary edits to enhance readability.

##### **10**of 10Add Human Touch

While AI tools are a great help for translation, they lack the nuanced understanding that humans possess. For critical or sensitive content, consider reviewing the AI-generated translations by a human translator to ensure accuracy and cultural appropriateness

## Conclusion

Breaking language barriers in audio/video content is now more accessible than ever. By leveraging a good AI Spanish translation tool like Virbo and following the step-by-step guidance provided above, you can seamlessly **translate Spanish audio to English** or English voice to Spanish. Remember to adhere to our translation guidelines for crafting accurate translations.

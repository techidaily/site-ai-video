By translating your videos, you're making Twitter a more welcoming place for everyone. Regardless of their language. This builds a stronger community where diverse voices are valued and heard.

## **Part 2. Are There Built-in Translation Features on Twitter for Video?**

Twitter has limited features in terms of translation. Currently, Twitter only allows the translation of text within tweets. There are no built-in features for translating video content directly on the platform. But, you can enable closed captions to aid in understanding video content.

Here are the steps to turn on closed captions videos on Twitter:

- **Step 1.** Open the Twitter app or website and find the video tweet that you want to watch with closed captions. This tweet could be in your timeline or a user's profile.
- **Step 2.** Tap the video's thumbnail to play the video.
- **Step 3.** Tap on the three dots at the top right of the screen to bring up the video player controls.
